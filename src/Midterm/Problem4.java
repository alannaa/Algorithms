  3.3.29 Optimal storage. Modify RedBlackBST so that it does not use any extra
  storage for the color bit, based on the following trick: To color a node red,
  swap its two links. Then, to test whether a node is red, test whether its
  left child is larger than its right child. You have to modify the compares
  to accommodate the possible link swap, and this trick replaces bit compares
  with key compares that are presumably more expensive, but it shows that the
  bit in the nodes can be eliminated, if necessary.
